== About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in [https://www.oden.utexas.edu/academics/phd-program/ Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM)] at the [https://www.oden.utexas.edu/ Oden Institute] of [https://www.utexas.edu/ UT Austin], advised by [https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~pgm/ Prof. Per-Gunnar Martinsson] and [https://sites.google.com/prod/view/rward Prof. Rachel Ward]. I will be joining the [https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/ Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences] at [https://www.nyu.edu/ New York University] as a Courant Instructor (postdoc) in September 2023.

My research lies in *randomized numerical linear algebra* and *theoretical machine learning*. In synopsis, I am interested in the computational and sample efficiency of algorithms in machine learning and scientific computing. From the computational efficiency perspective, my work is centered on matrix sketching and randomized low-rank decompositions like SVD and CUR. From the sample efficiency perspective, my work focuses on the generalization and distributional robustness of learning algorithms in data-limited settings.
