== About me
I am a Ph.D. student in the [https://www.oden.utexas.edu/academics/phd-program/ Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM)] program at the Oden Institute of UT Austin.
I feel fortunate to have [https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~pgm/ Prof. Per-Gunnar Martinsson] and [https://sites.google.com/prod/view/rward Prof. Rachel Ward] as my advisors.
My research interests lie in *randomized numerical linear algebra* and *theoretical machine learning*.
